# gh-notetaker-redux
Github note taker React Native App with React Navigation TabNavigator and Redux

This my extension to @tylermcginnis's Notetaker with React Native 
react-native-gh-notetaker at https://github.com/tylermcginnis/react-native-gh-notetaker.git

Code has been updated to support  "react": "16.0.0-alpha.6" & "react-native": "0.44.0"

App is using Facebook's new Native standalone React-Navigation library for navigation 
across iOS and Android: "react-navigation": "^1.0.0-beta.9"

Redux predictable state container is used for store management:  "react-redux": "^5.0.3"

Redux-Saga is used to handle asynchronous data fetching:  "redux-saga": "^0.15.3"

This is just my personal effort to support the latest updates and I will try to extend it to support other features.
